However, the Anemo Hypostasis applies a long-lasting Anemo status to itself while its core is exposed, and unlike Persistent Geo on Geo Hypostasis and Planet Befall it can react with other elements to trigger Swirl - albeit it has an Internal Cooldown which disallows it from activating Swirl again before a set amount of time passes. Additionally, Jean's Elemental Burst Dandelion Breeze continuously and periodically applies Anemo to characters that stand in the talent's area of effect until the effect dissipates, but the Anemo status effect does not behave any differently from a normal Anemo status effect and will disappear momentarily after application until the next periodic application occurs by the talent."
