Any source of Pyro DMG will apply the Pyro status. Flaming Flowers and Pyro Boom Blossoms do not inherently apply Pyro, but are often surrounded by grass and will inflict Burning damage. Any lit torch, campfire, or cooking pot will cause Burning damage if the active character comes too close to them."

        "description": "Similar to the Geo status, the Anemo status is ephemeral and will either react immediately with pre-applied elements or disappear instantly after application if no other elements are applied when applied to an enemy. However, the Anemo Hypostasis applies a long-lasting Anemo status to itself while its core is exposed, and unlike Persistent Geo on Geo Hypostasis and Planet Befall it can react with other elements to trigger Swirl - albeit it has an Internal Cooldown which disallows it from activating Swirl again before a set amount of time passes. Additionally, Jean's Elemental Burst Dandelion Breeze continuously and periodically applies Anemo to characters that stand in the talent's area of effect until the effect dissipates, but the Anemo status effect does not behave any differently from a normal Anemo status effect and will disappear momentarily after application until the next periodic application occurs by the talent."

Certain mechanics in Inazuma, such as the Lightning Strike Probe, will respond to characters or monsters affected by Electro. Any source of Electro DMG, including Electro Crystals, will apply the Electro status. Getting struck by lightning or entering a body of water struck by lightning during a thunderstorm will also apply Electro."

However, Geo Hypostasis as well as Stonehide Lawachurl and Large Geo Slime whilst their shields are active have a perpetual Geo status applied to them, but it cannot react with other elements to trigger Crystallize. Another exception exists: Zhongli's Elemental Burst, Planet Befall, is capable of applying a persistent Geo status effect for the duration of his Petrification."

        "description": "Cryo is a status effect that reduces overall character speed. While affected by the Cryo status, all animation speed will decrease by 15% (stacking multiplicatively). This is not to be confused with Sheer Cold, an environmental mechanic that is the result of the Subzero Climate. Unlike other elements, the Cryo status can also be applied to certain objects, such as Ores, Thunderwoods, Thunder Dwellings, and Amber's Baron Bunny, and can allow certain elemental reactions to occur on such objects."
