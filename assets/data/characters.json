This has a lot of consistency due to its independence from Electro aura, and it is more viable in Spiral Abyss.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>\nSet 3 should be used with Electro-charged team compositions (<a href=\"characters/keqing\" class=\"character-link\">Keqing</a> + <a href=\"characters/xingqiu\" class=\"character-link\">Xingqiu</a>), or single electro team comp, but this is <b>NOT</b> recommended. This set has a 35% damage modifier, which increases all damage from all sources, although that modifier is a bit unstable due to it's dependency to the sustainability of Electro aura on enemies.</p></li>\n\n\n</ul>",
